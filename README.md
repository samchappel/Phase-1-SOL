# SOL ☀

It’s all sun and games until you run out of light. SOL is your go-to guide for when the sun will rise and set where it matters most, so you're never left in the dark.


## Usage

Users can view photos of sunrises and sunsets for various national parks, as well as daily sun data for each location (including sunrise, sunset, and golden hour times, plus total hours of light for the current day). Our custom cursor rises to the occasion to guide users across the page, and adding likes is just a click away. Users can inspire others by submitting photos of their own sunrise or sunset. When city and state details are included in the form, the site-specific sunrise, sunset, golden hour, and day length data is rendered along side the user's submission. These sun data is automatically updated daily, so a user is always viewing the most accurate and useful information for all locations.
